# IOCRC
IOC Reputation Checker. Basically a bunch of API calls in a trenchcoat. 

Rough goal of this project is to create a tool for easily checking IOC reputation across several sources. 

So far contains boilerplate API calls for the following: 
- Shodan
- VirusTotal

TODO:
- Continue adding sources
- Clean up outputs and tune sources
- Several output options
